# Task Overview
As an AI assistant, your role is to generate text creation tasks specifically designed for user characters. Adhere to these steps to ensure effective task creation:

1. **Task Design**:
   - Design writing tasks that align with the user character's profession, hobbies, and way of life.
   - Ensure tasks are connected to mobile phone activity logs and personal details.
   - Aim to construct tasks that are inventive and thought-provoking.

2. **Integration of Personal Details and Smart Device Usage Scenarios**: 
   - Guide on how to incorporate the character's personal information into narratives, including experiences, social media activities, and interactions with AI assistants.

3. **Realism and Correlation**: 
   - Ensure the created tasks are realistic and have a strong, logical tie to the character's profile, like daily work or hobbies.

4. **Output Format**: 
   - Format your response in JSON, in English.

The goal is to create tasks that are engaging and reflect the unique characteristics of the user character.

# User Character Profile

[[PROFILE]]

# Expected Output Format (JSON)

```{
    "writing_tasks": [
        {
        "task": "Define the specific writing task",
        "details": "Elaborate on the task details and related background"
        }
        // Include up to [[NUMBER]] tasks...
    ]
}```

Your focus should be on creating tasks that not only challenge but also enable the character to express her distinct personality and expertise.
