The source code of the ACL 2024 main conference paper: [CoGenesis: A Framework Collaborating Large and Small Language Models for Secure Context-Aware Instruction Following.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03129)



## Highlights of the Paper

In this paper, we highlight our contributions as follows:

- We introduce the context-aware instruction-following task that incorporates extensive user privacy context information. To support this, we design a four-step data construction process and synthesize a modest amount of instructional data for experimental validation. 
- We investigate the performance of LLMs and SLMs on this task. Our findings indicate that SLMs, when provided with context, can outperform LLMs lacking context but lag behind the performance of LLMs equipped with context. 
- For contextaware instruction generation, we present the CoGenesis framework. CoGenesis comprises sketchbased and logit-based variants to facilitate collaboration between large and small language models. This approach not only safeguards context privacy but also ensures performance gains.



## Context-aware Instruction-following Dataset

### Construction Pipeline

We constructed the dataset through the following four-step process:

- **Group Portraits.** We begin by constructing highly diverse user group portraits from the real
  world, encompassing a wide range of groups such as college students, programmers, and various other
  professions. See [Prompts](data/prompts/task1_group_portraits.md).
- **User Profile.** Building upon our diverse user group portraits, we next develop individual user profiles with rich detail. See [Prompts](data/prompts/task2_user_characters.md).
- **Writing Task Instructions.** In this phase, we craft text creation tasks tailored to our user characters, ensuring alignment with their professions, hobbies, and lifestyles.  See [Prompts](data/prompts/ task3_creative_tasks.md).

- **Personalized Generations.** Here, we produce personalized texts adhering to specific guidelines. Our focus is on crafting authentic and coherent narratives that vividly reflect each characterâ€™s professional and personal life. See [Prompts](data/prompts/task4_personalized_text.md).

### Datasets for Ablation

For our ablation studies, we provide datasets both with and without contextual information:

```bash
$ ls data/ablation
ctx_dev.json     ctx_test.json     ctx_train.json     paper_dev.json     paper_test.json     paper_train.json
ctx_dev_wo.json  ctx_test_wo.json  ctx_train_wo.json  paper_dev_wo.json  paper_test_wo.json  paper_train_wo.json
```

Note: The email dataset must be obtained from the [LDC: Avocado Research Email Collection](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T03) and is not included in this repository.

## The CoGenesis Framework

![](assert/figure3.jpg)

We propose two variants within the CoGenesis framework for collaborative generation: sketch-based and logits-based.

- **Sketch-based Method:** Initially, large language models (LLMs) generate a preliminary sketch of a response based on general instructions. Subsequently, small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on specialized context-aware datasets using these sketches.

- **Logits-based Method:** This approach begins with direct fine-tuning of SLMs on specialized context-aware datasets. Following this, we combine models by integrating logits from both small and large LMs, evaluated both with and without context.



### Sketch-based CoGenesis

- **Step 1. Prompt LLMs:** Generate initial response sketches based on general instructions.

  ```bash
  # set args for API calls, including OpenAI or local deployment
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="EMPTY"
  export OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:8000/v1"
  
  # generate sketch from local LLMs and OpenAI
  cd src/sketch
  python run_extract_outline_loc.py --model_name_or_path "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --model_name "Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --tp_size 8
  
  python run_extract_outline_oai.py --task ctx --mode without --split train --model_name "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"
  ```

- **Step 2. Fine-tune SLMs:** Utilize the sketches along with general instructions and detailed personal context to refine the small models.

  ```bash
  cp "src/sketch/outputs/*" "./data/ablation"
  # for Qwen1.5 finetuning
  bash run_train.sh "with_outline_Qwen1.5-72B-Chat"
  ```

- **Step 3. Inference:** Run inference with fintuned small LMs.

  ```bash
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python run_infer.py --data_dir "./data/ablation" --test_path "ctx_test.json" --output "Qwen-1_8B-Chat_sample.json" --num_beams 1 --do_sample True --model_path "Qwen-1_8B-Chat-SFT" --output_dir "outputs/results/ctx/sketch"
  ```

  



### Logits-based CoGenesis

- **Step 1. Fine-tune SLMs:** Directly refine SLMs using specialized context-aware datasets that include personal context data.

  ```bash
  # finetune models with context
  bash run_train.sh ""
  
  # finetune models without context
  bash run_train.sh "_wo"
  ```

- **Step 2. Extract and Train:** Retrieve logits from both LLMs and SLMs under varying context conditions and integrate these into a combined model for efficient logits fusion.

  ```bash
  # extract logits from LLMs and SLMs under with and without context settings, respectively
  python run_extract_logits.py --model_name_or_path "Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-SFT" --model_name "Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat" --mode "with" --tp_size 4 --bsz 1 --gmu 0.4
  
  python run_extract_logits.py --model_name_or_path "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --model_name "Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --mode "without" --tp_size 8 --bsz 1 --gmu 0.8
  
  # train combined models with logits for collaborative generations
  python run_fuse_logits.py --task "ctx" --small_model "Qwen1.5-1_8B-Chat" --large_model "Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --small_config "Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat"
  ```

- **Step 3. Inference:** Run inference using logits-based collaborative generation. We utilize SLMs locally and LLMs in the cloud (via APIs based on vLLM). In our implementation, we modify the typical sampling process to return logits instead of the log probabilities (logprob) used in OpenAIâ€™s APIs.

  ```bash
  # run vLLM server
  python run_serve.py --host 0.0.0.0 --model "Qwen/Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --trust-remote-code --tensor-parallel-size 8
  
  # set parameters for inference, we can set P/K/T to speed generations
  python run_cogen_with_logits.py --task "ctx" --model_path "Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-SFT" --small_model_name "Qwen1.5-1_8B-Chat" --large_model_name "Qwen1.5-72B-Chat" --P 1 --K 1 --T 1
  ```



### Modification in vLLM

> !!! Modifying sampling process in vLLM library, we need to get logits directly rather than logprob.

```bash
# Path: miniconda3/envs/transformers/lib/python3.10/site-packages/vllm/model_executor/layers/sampler.py
# Line: 49-118
    def forward(
        self,
        logits: torch.Tensor,
        sampling_metadata: SamplingMetadata,
    ) -> Optional[SamplerOutput]:
        """
        Args:
            logits: (num_tokens, vocab_size).
            sampling_metadata: Metadata for sampling.
        """
        # ...
        
        # We use float32 for probabilities and log probabilities.
        # Compute the probabilities.
        probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1, dtype=torch.float)
        # Compute the log probabilities.
        # logprobs = torch.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1, dtype=torch.float)
				logprobs = logits

        # ...
        # Get the logprobs query results.
        prompt_logprobs, sample_logprobs = _get_logprobs(
            logprobs, sampling_metadata, sample_results)
        return _build_sampler_output(sample_results,
                                     sampling_metadata,
                                     prompt_logprobs,
                                     sample_logprobs,
                                     on_device_tensors=on_device_tensors)
```



### Automatic Evaluation

We evaluate our models using the `gpt-4-turbo` APIs.

```bash
python llm_evaluator_parallel.py --task "ctx" --filename "PATH_TO_RESULT" --model_name "Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-SFT" --save_folder "outputs"
```
